# Chapter 4: The Instruction Cookbook
*Your Processor's Recipe Book*

## Introduction: Every Instruction Tells a Story

In the culinary world, a master chef doesn't just know recipesâ€”they understand the chemistry behind cooking, the interaction of ingredients, and how different techniques achieve different results. Similarly, mastering assembly programming requires understanding not just what instructions do, but why they exist, how they interact, and when to use each one for maximum effect.

The x86/x64 instruction set is like a vast cookbook, containing hundreds of recipes for computational tasks. Some instructions are everyday staples you'll use constantly, others are specialized tools for specific situations, and a few are exotic techniques that can work miracles in the right hands.

In this chapter, we'll explore the instruction set not as a dry reference, but as a living collection of computational tools. You'll learn to think like the processor itself, understanding how instructions are encoded, executed, and optimized. By the end of this chapter, you'll have the knowledge to choose the perfect instruction for any task and combine instructions into efficient algorithms.

## Building Complex Operations from Simple Commands

### The Art of Instruction Selection

Every complex operation your program performs is built from simple, atomic instructions. The art lies in choosing the right combination of instructions to achieve your goal efficiently. Let's start with a practical example: implementing a function to find the maximum value in an array.

**The Naive Approach:**
```assembly
find_max_simple:
    ; Find maximum value in array
    ; ESI = array pointer, ECX = element count
    ; Returns maximum in EAX
    
    mov eax, [esi]                 ; Assume first element is max
    add esi, 4                     ; Point to second element
    dec ecx                        ; One less element to check
    
max_loop:
    cmp [esi], eax                 ; Compare current with max
    jle not_greater                ; Jump if not greater
    mov eax, [esi]                 ; New maximum found
not_greater:
    add esi, 4                     ; Next element
    loop max_loop                  ; Continue until done
    
    ret
```

**The Optimized Approach:**
```assembly
find_max_optimized:
    ; Optimized maximum finder using conditional moves
    ; ESI = array pointer, ECX = element count
    ; Returns maximum in EAX
    
    mov eax, [esi]                 ; Initial maximum
    add esi, 4                     ; Point to second element
    dec ecx                        ; Adjust count
    jz max_done                    ; Handle single-element case
    
max_loop_opt:
    mov edx, [esi]                 ; Load current element
    cmp edx, eax                   ; Compare with maximum
    cmovg eax, edx                 ; Conditionally move if greater
    add esi, 4                     ; Next element
    loop max_loop_opt              ; Continue
    
max_done:
    ret
```

The optimized version uses the `CMOVG` (conditional move if greater) instruction, which eliminates the branch prediction penalty of the jump instruction. This single change can make the function 20-30% faster on modern processors.

### Understanding Instruction Categories

The x86/x64 instruction set can be organized into logical categories, each serving specific computational purposes:

**1. Data Movement Instructions**
These are the workhorses of assembly programming:

```assembly
section '.data' data readable writeable
    source_value    dd 12345
    dest_value      dd 0
    array_data     dd 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    
section '.code' code readable executable

data_movement_examples:
    ; Basic moves
    mov eax, 42                    ; Immediate to register
    mov [dest_value], eax          ; Register to memory
    mov ebx, [source_value]        ; Memory to register
    mov ecx, ebx                   ; Register to register
    
    ; Zero/sign extension
    movzx eax, byte [source_value] ; Zero-extend byte to dword
    movsx ebx, word [source_value] ; Sign-extend word to dword
    
    ; String operations (powerful bulk moves)
    mov esi, array_data            ; Source
    mov edi, dest_value            ; Destination  
    mov ecx, 5                     ; Count
    rep movsd                      ; Move 5 dwords
    
    ; Exchange operations
    xchg eax, ebx                  ; Swap EAX and EBX
    
    ; Load effective address
    lea eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 8]     ; Calculate address without memory access
    
    ret
```

**2. Arithmetic Instructions**
The mathematical foundation of computation:

```assembly
arithmetic_examples:
    mov eax, 100
    mov ebx, 25
    
    ; Basic arithmetic
    add eax, ebx                   ; EAX = EAX + EBX (125)
    sub eax, 50                    ; EAX = EAX - 50 (75)
    imul eax, 2                    ; EAX = EAX * 2 (150)
    
    ; Division (more complex)
    mov edx, 0                     ; Clear high bits
    div ebx                        ; EAX = EAX / EBX, EDX = remainder
    
    ; Increment/decrement (faster than add/sub 1)
    inc eax                        ; EAX++
    dec ebx                        ; EBX--
    
    ; Negate
    neg eax                        ; EAX = -EAX
    
    ; Advanced arithmetic
    adc eax, ebx                   ; Add with carry
    sbb eax, ebx                   ; Subtract with borrow
    
    ret
```

**3. Logical and Bit Manipulation Instructions**
Essential for flag manipulation, masking, and bit-level operations:

```assembly
logical_examples:
    mov eax, 0xFF00FF00
    mov ebx, 0x0F0F0F0F
    
    ; Basic logical operations  
    and eax, ebx                   ; Bitwise AND
    or eax, 0x000000FF             ; Bitwise OR
    xor eax, eax                   ; Clear register (common idiom)
    not eax                        ; Bitwise NOT
    
    ; Shift operations
    shl eax, 4                     ; Shift left 4 bits (multiply by 16)
    shr ebx, 2                     ; Shift right 2 bits (divide by 4)
    sar ecx, 1                     ; Arithmetic right shift (preserves sign)
    
    ; Rotate operations
    rol eax, 8                     ; Rotate left 8 bits
    ror ebx, 4                     ; Rotate right 4 bits
    
    ; Bit testing and manipulation
    bt eax, 5                      ; Test bit 5 (sets carry flag)
    bts eax, 7                     ; Test and set bit 7
    btr eax, 3                     ; Test and reset bit 3
    btc eax, 1                     ; Test and complement bit 1
    
    ; Bit scanning
    bsf eax, ebx                   ; Bit scan forward (find first set bit)
    bsr eax, ebx                   ; Bit scan reverse (find last set bit)
    
    ret
```

**4. Control Flow Instructions**
The skeleton that gives your program structure:

```assembly
control_flow_examples:
    mov eax, 10
    mov ebx, 5
    
    ; Comparison and conditional jumps
    cmp eax, ebx                   ; Compare EAX with EBX
    je equal                       ; Jump if equal
    jg greater                     ; Jump if greater
    jl less                        ; Jump if less
    
    ; Unconditional jump
    jmp done
    
equal:
    ; Handle equal case
    mov ecx, 0
    jmp done
    
greater:
    ; Handle greater case
    mov ecx, 1
    jmp done
    
less:
    ; Handle less case
    mov ecx, -1
    
done:
    ; Loop constructs
    mov eax, 0                     ; Counter
    mov ebx, 10                    ; Limit
    
count_loop:
    inc eax
    cmp eax, ebx
    jl count_loop                  ; Continue if less than limit
    
    ; LOOP instruction (automatic counter)
    mov ecx, 10                    ; Loop counter
simple_loop:
    ; Do something 10 times
    loop simple_loop               ; Decrement ECX and jump if not zero
    
    ret
```

### Advanced Instructions and Extensions

Modern processors include many specialized instructions that can dramatically improve performance for specific tasks:

**SIMD Instructions (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):**
```assembly
section '.data' data readable writeable
    align 16
    vector1 dd 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0      ; 4 floats
    vector2 dd 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5      ; 4 floats
    result  dd 4 dup(0)                 ; Result vector
    
section '.code' code readable executable

simd_example:
    ; Load vectors into SIMD registers
    movaps xmm0, [vector1]         ; Move aligned packed singles
    movaps xmm1, [vector2]         ; Move aligned packed singles
    
    ; Perform parallel operations
    addps xmm0, xmm1               ; Add 4 floats in parallel
    mulps xmm0, xmm1               ; Multiply 4 floats in parallel
    
    ; Store result
    movaps [result], xmm0          ; Store 4 results at once
    
    ret
```

**String Processing Instructions:**
```assembly
string_operations:
    ; Set up for string operations
    mov esi, source_string         ; Source
    mov edi, dest_buffer           ; Destination
    mov ecx, string_length         ; Count
    
    ; Direction flag controls direction
    cld                            ; Clear direction flag (forward)
    
    ; Powerful string operations
    rep movsb                      ; Copy ECX bytes
    rep stosb                      ; Fill ECX bytes with AL
    repne scasb                    ; Search for AL in string
    
    ; Compare strings
    mov esi, string1
    mov edi, string2
    mov ecx, max_length
    repe cmpsb                     ; Compare until different or ECX=0
    
    ret
```

## The Art of Efficient Instruction Selection

### Performance Characteristics of Instructions

Not all instructions are created equal. Understanding the performance characteristics helps you write faster code:

```assembly
; Fast operations (1 cycle on modern processors)
mov eax, ebx                       ; Register-to-register move
add eax, ebx                       ; Register addition
inc eax                            ; Increment
dec eax                            ; Decrement
test eax, eax                      ; Test (often used instead of cmp eax, 0)

; Moderate operations (2-3 cycles)
mov eax, [ebx]                     ; Memory load
mov [ebx], eax                     ; Memory store
imul eax, ebx                      ; Integer multiply

; Expensive operations (10+ cycles)
div ebx                            ; Integer division
sqrt                               ; Square root
```

### Instruction Pairing and Superscalar Execution

Modern processors can execute multiple instructions simultaneously. Understanding this helps you write code that takes advantage of parallel execution:

```assembly
; Good pairing - these can execute in parallel
mov eax, [esi]                     ; Load (uses load unit)
add ebx, ecx                       ; Add (uses ALU)
mov edx, [edi]                     ; Another load (uses second load unit)

; Poor pairing - these compete for the same execution unit
add eax, ebx                       ; ALU operation
sub ecx, edx                       ; Another ALU operation
imul esi, edi                      ; Yet another ALU operation
```

### Optimization Through Instruction Choice

Here's a practical example showing how instruction choice affects performance:

```assembly
; Task: Clear an array of 1000 elements

; Method 1: Simple loop (slow)
clear_array_simple:
    mov edi, array_start
    mov ecx, 1000
clear_loop1:
    mov dword [edi], 0
    add edi, 4
    loop clear_loop1
    ret

; Method 2: Optimized loop (faster)  
clear_array_optimized:
    mov edi, array_start
    mov ecx, 1000
    xor eax, eax                   ; Clear EAX (faster than mov eax, 0)
clear_loop2:
    mov [edi], eax
    add edi, 4
    dec ecx                        ; DEC doesn't affect carry flag
    jnz clear_loop2                ; JNZ is faster than LOOP
    ret

; Method 3: String instruction (fastest)
clear_array_string:
    mov edi, array_start
    mov ecx, 1000
    xor eax, eax
    rep stosd                      ; Store EAX to [EDI] ECX times
    ret
```

The string instruction version is typically 5-10 times faster than the simple loop.

## Performance Secrets of Instruction Usage

### Branch Prediction and Code Layout

Modern processors predict which branches will be taken. Understanding this helps you write faster code:

```assembly
; Poor branch prediction (alternating pattern)
process_array_bad:
    mov esi, array_start
    mov ecx, array_size
    xor edx, edx                   ; Counter for statistics
    
bad_loop:
    mov eax, [esi]
    test eax, 1                    ; Check if odd
    jz even_number                 ; Branch taken 50% of the time
    
    ; Process odd number
    inc edx
    jmp continue_bad
    
even_number:
    ; Process even number
    
continue_bad:
    add esi, 4
    loop bad_loop
    ret

; Better branch prediction (reorganized code)
process_array_good:
    mov esi, array_start
    mov ecx, array_size
    xor edx, edx
    
good_loop:
    mov eax, [esi]
    test eax, 1
    jnz odd_number                 ; Less frequent case first
    
    ; Process even number (common case)
    add esi, 4
    loop good_loop
    ret
    
odd_number:
    ; Process odd number (less common case)
    inc edx
    add esi, 4
    loop good_loop
    ret
```

### Cache-Friendly Instruction Patterns

Some instruction sequences are more cache-friendly than others:

```assembly
; Cache-unfriendly: Complex addressing
process_matrix_bad:
    mov ebx, 0                     ; Row index
row_loop_bad:
    mov ecx, 0                     ; Column index
col_loop_bad:
    ; Calculate address: matrix[row][col]
    mov eax, ebx                   ; Row
    imul eax, MATRIX_WIDTH         ; * width
    add eax, ecx                   ; + column
    shl eax, 2                     ; * 4 bytes per element
    
    ; Process element
    inc dword [matrix + eax]
    
    inc ecx
    cmp ecx, MATRIX_WIDTH
    jl col_loop_bad
    
    inc ebx
    cmp ebx, MATRIX_HEIGHT  
    jl row_loop_bad
    ret

; Cache-friendly: Sequential access
process_matrix_good:
    mov esi, matrix                ; Pointer to current element
    mov ecx, MATRIX_ELEMENTS       ; Total elements
    
sequential_loop:
    inc dword [esi]                ; Process current element
    add esi, 4                     ; Move to next element
    loop sequential_loop
    ret
```

### Advanced Optimization Techniques

**Loop Unrolling:**
```assembly
; Standard loop
standard_sum:
    xor eax, eax                   ; Sum
    mov esi, array
    mov ecx, count
sum_loop:
    add eax, [esi]
    add esi, 4
    loop sum_loop
    ret

; Unrolled loop (processes 4 elements per iteration)
unrolled_sum:
    xor eax, eax
    mov esi, array
    mov ecx, count
    shr ecx, 2                     ; Divide by 4
    
unroll_loop:
    add eax, [esi]                 ; Element 0
    add eax, [esi + 4]             ; Element 1  
    add eax, [esi + 8]             ; Element 2
    add eax, [esi + 12]            ; Element 3
    add esi, 16                    ; Advance by 4 elements
    loop unroll_loop
    
    ; Handle remaining elements
    mov ecx, count
    and ecx, 3                     ; Remainder after division by 4
    jz unroll_done
    
remainder_loop:
    add eax, [esi]
    add esi, 4
    loop remainder_loop
    
unroll_done:
    ret
```

**Software Pipelining:**
```assembly
; Transform data with pipeline optimization
transform_pipeline:
    mov esi, input_array
    mov edi, output_array
    mov ecx, element_count
    
    ; Pre-load first element
    mov eax, [esi]                 ; Load
    add esi, 4
    
pipeline_loop:
    ; Stage 1: Transform previous element
    shl eax, 1                     ; Process loaded element
    add eax, 100
    
    ; Stage 2: Store previous, load next (parallel operations)
    mov [edi], eax                 ; Store result
    mov eax, [esi]                 ; Load next element (parallel)
    
    ; Advance pointers
    add edi, 4
    add esi, 4
    
    loop pipeline_loop
    
    ; Handle final element
    shl eax, 1
    add eax, 100
    mov [edi], eax
    
    ret
```
